# There is no closed-form solution for Logistic regression. 
# The MLE doesn't exist like for that exists for Linear Regression.

# Why doesn't a closed-form solution exist? Unlike Linear regression, which has
# this linear solution. The logistic regression makes use of this sigmoid function
# which makes it non-linear, and can't be directly derived in the closed form solution.
