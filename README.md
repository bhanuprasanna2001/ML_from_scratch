  - ✅ Closed Form
  - ✅ Gradient Descent
- ✅ Logistic Regression
  - ✅ Gradient Descent
- ✅ KNN
  - ✅ Weighted and Unweighted KNN Classification
  - ✅ Weighted and Unweighted KNN Regression
- ✅ K-Means
  - ✅ K-Means
- ✅ Naive Bayes
  - ✅ Naive Bayes
- ✅ SVM
  - ✅ SVC Soft Margin - Stochastic Sub Gradient Descent
  - ✅ SVC SMO
  - ✅ SVR
  - ✅ SVC using CVXOPT
- ✅ Decision Tree
  - ✅ Classifier
  - ✅ Regressor
- ✅ Random Forest
  - ✅ Classifier
  - ✅ Regressor
- ✅ Gradient Boosting

- Used AI for plots.
